# Welcome to Buy-Right

Buy-Right is a little fake e-commerce created as a reference for [this course](https://www.educative.io/collection/6586453712175104/5946216679735296) about testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

The website is built using `TypeScript`, `Next.js` and `PNPM` as the package manager.

2. Open a terminal in the project's root directory
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the project's dependencies

### Starting the Development Server

1. Open a terminal in the project's root directory
2. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the website

### Building the Production Version

1. Open a terminal in the project's root directory
2. Run `pnpm build` to build the production version of the website
3. Run `pnpm start` to start the production server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the website

### Testing

1. Open a terminal in the project's root directory
2. Run `pnpm test` to run the e2e tests using Playwright

## Project Structure

The project's source code is located in the `src` directory, and the compiled code is located in the `out` directory. The project's configuration files (e.g. `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`) are located in the project's root directory.

The `src/app` directory contains the website's pages, and the `src/components` directory contains reusable components.

The e2e tests are located in the `e2e` directory. The tests use Playwright to interact with the website and make assertions.
